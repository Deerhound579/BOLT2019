## Comparision and planning
The bar chart shows last month's spending per category. After the user created a spending plan, the bar chart will show the new plan based on the inputs. To get more accurate results, the outputs are calculated based on the user's spending for the last three months.
Unfortunately, the callback for changes in the spending plan is unimplemented due to time limits.
